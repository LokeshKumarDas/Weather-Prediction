# WeatherPrediction

In this project I tried to predict weather using concepts of Machine Learning. ML model can predict the rain, snowfall, or sunny weather based on the input features namely precipitation, min-max Temperature and wind. 

I used Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM and Decision Tree, further used their combined results for prediction.
